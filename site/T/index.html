<p><b>MORRIS</b> a New Zealand word for devil, often applied by settlers to a vicious horse or as a name for a dog. There is a dangerous river, the Taipo, on the west coast. There is considerable dispute as to whether the word is true Maori or not. The Rev. T. G. Hammond of Patea says - --&gt;<code>No such Maori word as taipo, meaning devil, exists. It would mean evening-tide - tai-po. Probably the early sailors introduced attached meaning of devil from the Maori saying,</code>Are you not afraid to travel at night?' referring to the danger of tidal rivers.' --&gt;On the hand, Mr. Tregear says, in his <code>Maori Comparative Dictionary,' s.v. - --&gt;</code>Taepo, a goblin, a spectre. C.f. <i>tae</i>, to arrive; <i>po</i>, night.' The Rev. W. Colenso says, in his pamphlet on <code>Nomenclature' (1883), p. 5 - --&gt;</code>Taepo means to visit or come by night, - a night visitant, - a spectral thing seen in dreams, - a fancied and feared thing, or hobgoblin, of the night or darkness; and this the settlers have construed to mean the Devil! - and of course their own orthodox one.' <i>(1898,Austral English,454</i>)</p>

There is a Maori remark that may be quoted here: Haere ra! E tama E! Mou te tai ata, moku te tai po (Farewell! O son! lit. Yours the morning tide, mine the evening tide, meaning You pass with the morning tide, as I will pass by the evening tide). The saying was often used in war, when a man saw a young relative or friend slain; and the words were often prophetic of his own fate. The meaning is quite destroyed if the last two words are run together - taipo instead of tai po: that results in the word under discussion, making the meaning: You pass on the morning tide, while I go to the devil! - naturally a modern interpretation. A Pakeha using the expression once confused that last words and made them taepa; when it meant: You pass on the morning tide, while I get over the fence.

<p>All the clubs have added a race for the new Takapuna one-design class... The first boat is now ready for launching... Some difficulty is being experienced in getting the sails, owing to a shortage of the necessary silk cloth. <i>(Oct 29, 1921,Auckland  Star,18</i>)</p>
<p>The latest class, the Takapuna, 12 ft 6 in flatties, are very handy little craft, and ideal for racing or knocking about the sheltered bays and beaches of Takapuna. <i>(Nov 26, 1921,Auckland  Star,18</i>)</p>

<p><b>CARTER</b> Next to the X class. is the Z class, or what are often referred to as the Cornwall Cup boats. They owe their existence to a small band of Takapuna yachtsmen who planned the first boat, with much the same idea in their minds as did George Honour when he built the first of the 14-foot square bilge boats, namely, low first cost, ease of construction, and an ever-watchful eye on speed and performance under Auckland harbour weather conditions. The yachts were originally designed for the Takapuna Boating Club but owing to their popularity from the outset the type was quickly adopted by many other yacht clubs throughout New Zealand... From small beginnings the Takapuna one-design class rapidly expanded. <i>(1944,Little Ships: NZ's Yachting Fleet,127</i>)</p>
<p><b>TITCHENER</b> A good example.. was the design of the famous but ill-fated Z-class, which became known as the Takapuna class throughout New Zealand. <i>(1978,Little Ships of NZ,64</i>) [NOTES: [Specifications - 3.8 m yacht, designed by R B Brown of Northcote. 1.5m beam,m square chine vee-bottom principle. The whole of the sailing area carried on a gunter mainsail, on a short mast forward, no bowsprit or headsail]]</p>
<p><b>DAVIS</b> The Z class, or "Zeddie" as it was affectionately known, was another class which was designed as a low cost sailing boat to get the boys into something safer than the tin canoes or derelict dinghies in which they cruised Shoal Bay. Ibid. 114 The Takapuna Boating Club which was then situated at Bayswater, was the sponsoring club and the yachts were often referred to as the "Takapuna Class". <i>(1989,Kohimarama,113</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The tamarillo, it seems, is still a fruit New Zealand has largely to itself, for though it is grown in private gardens around the world in warm frost-free places like California, South Africa, Asia and Africa, only here is it cultivated systematically on a commercial scale... In the 1880s, Mr D Morris, director of the Botanbical Gardens in Jamaica, sent seeds to the hill districts of India and Sri Lanka, and it was from northern India that the first seeds were sent to New Zealand, to Hay and Sons, nurserymen of Parnell in Auckland. The Hay's 1891-1892 catalogue states that the nursery then had "plants of strong and healthy appearance" for sale... The name "tamarillo" officially came into being on January 31, 1967, after New Zealand exporters decided a more romantic, exotic name was needed than "tree tomato". The strategy worked, and today tamarillo seems to have become the accepted name internationally. <i>(Jun 12, 2004,Dominion Post,E8</i>)</p>
<p>He cites the economic potential of the pepino on a par with the tamarillo. <i>(Jun 1982,Orchardist NZ,143</i>)</p>
<p>On February 1, 1967, the name tamarillo officially replaced tree tomato. <i>(Feb 1967,Orchardist NZ,23</i>)</p>
<p>The tamarillo or tree tomato, <i>Cyphomandra betacea</i> Sendt.. is a native of Brazil and Peru. <i>(Jun 1970,Orchardist NZ,149</i>)</p>

<p><b>BURTON</b> A native of the Andean region of Peru and of southern Brazil, the tamarillo is the only one of the 30 species of its genus, Cyphomandra, to be widely known...It was from northern India that the first seeds were sent to New Zealand, in 1891, to D. Hay &amp; Sons, nurserymen of Parnell, Auckland. <i>(1985,Delectable Fruits Cookery,145</i>)</p>
<p>Gently peel the tamarillos then carefully slide them into the simmering syrup. <i>(Sep 1999,Cuisine,No. 76 : 86</i>)</p>
<p>The Sex Kitten uses perfectly ripe tamarillos, blended with homemade vanilla sugar syrup and extra vanilla scraped from the pod, strained and frozen into ice cubes. <i>(Sep 11, 2003,Dominion Post,D1</i>)</p>
<p>Although it sounds Spanish, the name 'tamarillo' is another New Zealand invention. The former name 'tree tomato', was considered inappropriate for use overseas where people buying the fruits for the first time might expect them to taste like tomatoes. In 1967, orchardist Bill Thomson took the Maori word 'tama' added 'tillo' (taken from tomatillo, a complete unrelated Mexican fruit) and then (just to make the sound more mellifluous) he replaced 't' with an 'r'. Thus, 'tamarillo' was born. <i>(Apr 1991,NZ Geographic,58</i>)</p>
<p>So if you are a true New Zealander who enjoys cutting a tamarillo in half and scooping out the juicy flesh straight into your mouth, there is still plenty of time for this refreshing tonic. <i>(Aug 20, 2005,Listener (New Zealand Listener),58</i>)</p>

<p>The currency of <i>tree tomato</i> (p. 263) might also owe something to New Zealand, where the tree is well known and has always been called <i>tree tomato </i>(until in 1967 the growers decided to change the name to <i>tamarillo</i>, thought to be a better name for publicity). <i>(1968,Anglia,86/359</i>) [NOTES: G.W.Turner review Pitcairnese Language]</p>

<p>Supplies of tropical fruits were curtailed because of the Japanese threats to the sea lanes, and tamarillo (or tree tomato as they were then known) growing began in earnest. [WWII] <i>Ibid.</i> 141 An uncultivated native of the Andes region of Peru, the tamarillo is also found wild in India, Sri Lanka and parts of South East Asia. It was from the hilly regions of northern India that New Zealand's first seeds came, introduced by the Auckland nursery of D. Hay and Sons in 1891. At first only the yellow and purple varieties were grown and it was not until the end of World War I that the now almost universal red variety was bred at Mangere, Auckland. <i>(1982,Two Hundred Years of NZ Food &amp; Cookery,31</i>)</p>
<p>Two well-known New Zealand exports, neither of them native, are tree-tomatoes and Chinese gooseberries, but neither is called that by the exporters. The tomatoes are a South American fruit, a rich source of vitamin C and long popular in New Zealand. About twenty years ago, the name <i>tamarillo</i> was deliberately contrived, much as a brand name is. On the basis of <i>tomato</i>, a diminutive<i> -ill-</i> was added; then <i>tomatillo</i> was altered, in honor of a legendary Maori tribal hero, Tama-te-kapua, to <i>tamatillo</i>; and then a change to <i>tamarillo</i> was considered more euphonious. And so a new word was born. <i>(1985,Verbatim,2/11</i>) [NOTES: (G.W.Turner)]</p>

<p><b>PHILLIPPS</b> A material similar in appearance to greenstone, but known to the geologists as bowenite and to the Maori as tangiwai, is widely used in the same manner as greenstone.

<p>There are two kinds of greenstone, that which is commonly seen, and which is named the ponamoo, and another sort more glassy and transparent named tuggewai ... the tuggewai is much softer, of a more transparent green, and divides easily into plates. <i>(Oct 5, 1844,Nelson Examiner and New Zealand Chronicle,3</i>)</p>

<p>Tangiwai is clear like glass, and ranges from olive-gree to bluish green. Most tangiwai is sourced from two isolated areas at Piopiotahi (Milford Sound). Koko-tangiwai, the longer name for this stone, referes to a deep sorrow that is never completely healed. <i>(Oct 23, 2009,Press, The,4</i>)</p>

<p><b>MAJORIBANKS</b> The <code>tapu' or tabboo is a ceremony common to New Zealand, along with all the other South Sea Islands. The power of</code>tapuing' seems to be vested in the principal chief alone, and may be considered the most important bulwark of his authority. This ceremony [90] renders every object, either animate or inanimate, sacred, or not to be approached, so that no person can enter tapued ground, nor touch a tapued person. Every girl promised in marriage is tapued, and married women also, until chastised by their husbands, when the `tapu' ceases, and they are then free to any one who can catch them, a remarkably good plan for securing the affections of the husband, and relieving the sex from some of those periodical chastisements in which some of the husbands in this country are so apt to indulge.

<p>As it was a test suit by which their right to all the other sections was to be determined, their claim to the 'tenths' has passed away. <i>(1877,NZ Parliamentary Debates,517</i>)</p>
<p>The matter is still further complicated by the stipulation attached to the various trusts, such as the Kemp Trust, and the Native tenths, from which some of the medical officers are paid. <i>(May 16, 1913,Poverty Bay Herald,8</i>)</p>
<p>Attempts to place a contemporary value on the nearly four million acres Ngai Tahu should have owned had the Crown set aside the promised "tenth" of all land sold is extraordinarily difficult. <i>(Nov 1993,North &amp; South,60</i>)</p>
<p>The Whakarewa Grant was part of what was called the <code>tenth', a term coined by the New Zealand Company for land it reserved for Maori people. The principle of the tenths was conveyed in the instructions from the New Zealand Company in 1839 to its principal agent, Colonel William Wakefield, before he set out for New Zealand. In</code>every purchase of land from the natives ... a proportion of the territory ceded will be reserved by the Company and held in trust by them for the future benefit of the chief families of the tribe ... <code>You will explain that after English immigration and settlement a tenth of the land will be far more valuable than the whole was before'. ... To Alexander MacKay, commissioner of Native Lands, writing in 1872, the tenths</code>guarded the natives that common failing of all Aboriginal races, want of foresight, and it secured them from the dangers to which colonisation exposed them'. In short, land was a better asset for the Maoris than cash. In Nelson, the `tenth' comprised a total of 15,000 acres of land, involving a mix of urban and rural land in Nelson, Motueka, and Golden Bay. Most of that land remains in Maori ownership and today is managed by an incorporation. The Whakarewa land - the most valuable area of the tenth - has however been subverted from the control of the ... <i>(Jul 1986,New Outlook,28</i>)</p>
<p>[Colonel William Wakefield] set about negotiating the purchase of some 160,000 acres and in Septmeber 1839 a deed of purpose, written in English, was signed by 16 local chiefs. It provided that one tenth of the land purchased would be reserved for the Maori owners of the Land... No proper explanation was given to Maori of the 'tenths' reserve scheme, nor were they made aware that the deed of purchase made no provision for the retention by Maori of their pa, cultivations, and burial grounds. <i>(Jun 2003,Wel-com (Wellington),13</i>)</p>
<p>They claim that they are descended from one of the chiefs who sold the land around Port Nicholson to Col. Wakefield in the early days of settlement, and that they are entitled to their share of what are known as the Wellington tenths. <i>(Sep 6, 1899,Evening Post,5</i>)</p>
<p>Fortunately for some of the Maoris of the Porirua and Hutt districts they are in receipt of small yearly sums from the proceeds of their interests in the Nelson and Wellington "tenths" and the rents of small pieces of land. <i>(Nov 2, 1906,Evening Post,6</i>)</p>
<p>Of the 110,000 acres so measured one tenth part is to be reserved for the use or benefit of the aborigines, according to the original plan of sale proposed by the New Zealand company; and the lands for the aborigines shall be selected by lot, as provided for by the same plan of sale. <i>(Dec 10, 1840,New Zealand Gazette &amp; Wellington Spectator,1</i>)</p>

<p><i>n.</i> (Rural) an exchange of some Crown-leased land for conservation purposes, for freehold title to the remainder of a leased property.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's called "tenure review", an unremarkable term for a remarkable transformation now taking place in our legendary South Island high country. In exchange for giving up the scenic and uneconomic parts of their land for a massive conservation estate, pastoral lease holders get freehold title to the rest of their property. [18] Currently, the main way of achieving it [sc. taking land for the conservation estate]is known as tenure review; a huge land swap inside the pastoral leases that make up 20 percent of the South Island and 10 percent of New Zealand. <i>(Jul 12, 2003,Listener (New Zealand Listener),16</i>)</p>
<p>When Jim Morris of Ben Avon Station entered tenure review, he did it with an open mind, prepared to move with the times and embrace the consequences. <i>(Jun 2007,Conservation Action,17</i>)</p>
<p>High-country farmers are quietly opting for tenure review because many are likely to become wealthy from what is [7] one of the best real estate deals in New Zealand in the last 50 years... I suspect that history will judge tenure review as not such a great idea for farmning or the public... What should have happened is a careful review of the pastoral lease system to maintain this unique form of land tenure, with adjustments to assist farmers to diversify and to protect uneconomic land. <i>(Jul 26, 2003,Listener (New Zealand Listener),6</i>)</p>
<p><b>Relph</b> After six years about two-thirds of the 300 pastoral leases in the South Island have passed through or are undergoing tenure review. <i>(2007,From Tussocks to Tourists,144</i>)</p>
<p>Tenure review is a voluntary process for owners of high-country leases who may trade off areas of high conservation value to the conservation estate in return for freeholding the rest of their farms. <i>(Oct 9, 2004,Listener (New Zealand Listener),17</i>)</p>

<p>DELUGED [heading] I am beginning to think that I must be the only ignoramus in Dunedin who has never heard of a thunderplump. Everyone else has known the word since childhood and, as a Buccleugh Street reader neatly put it, I was fairly deluged with thunderplumps yesterday. Other readers wanted to explain that <code>plumps' were to be found in many dictionaries, but I was aware of that anyway. Most of the people who knew of thunderplump claimed a Scottish origin for it, but it still took me quite a time to locate it in my range of dictionaries. Finally I ran it to earth in a seven-volume Century, published back in 1891, which gave it as</code>A short violent downpour of rain in connection with a thunder-storm (Rare),' and produced a 19th century quotation. Perhaps we didn't hear it much in Invercargill in my younger days because thunderplumps are pretty uncommon there; but a colleague who came from Winton certainly knew of it; and it was even noised abroad by the Canterbury English. ... <i>(Nov 18, 1977,Otago Daily Times</i>) [NOTES: (Griffiths Collection)]</p>

<p>I must correct you as to the origin of 'toby'. It's not Irish for road. It is Gaelic for 'spring'. My ancestors built the navigation canals in the UK.

<p>What is the origin of the "toby". the tap that turns off water at the street frontage of a house?... I am prepared to wager that it is derived from "toby", which was the gypsy-tinker slang term for "street. There is an early link between tinkers and plumbers, both being experts with the soldering-iron, and I think the plumbers took over "toby" from the tinkers. Consequently, when they turned water off "at the toby" they were turning it off at the street. <i>(Jun 11, 1983,Listener (New Zealand Listener),56</i>) [NOTES: Ian Gordon]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>insect larva Order 4 (alder-flies) is represented in New Zealand by only a single species <i>Archicauliodes dubitatus</i>, an insect of large size, whose fat, succulent larva is found under rocks in streams, and forms excellent food for trout. This larva is called the <code>black creper,' or sometimes the</code>toe-biter'. <i>(Jan 1921,NZ Journal of Science &amp; Technology,3/273</i>) [NOTES: (Tillyard)]</p>
<p><b>NATUSCH</b> The Dobson fly ... is a speckled orange-winged insect which flits weakly over streams at dusk.

<p>It is perfectly true that the big bags early in the season are obtained principally by the aid of the "toe-biter," which "hangs out" under stones near the water's edge; but matters adjust themselves later, for the "toe-biters" develop into a fly or something, and they are no longer found in any number. <i>(Nov 2, 1901,Nelson Evening Mail,2</i>)</p>

The word has been explained as of convict origin, that the rags were used to soothe the galling of fetters; but the explanation is not satisfactory, for the part galled by the irons would not be the toe, but the ankle. A writer in `Truth' has cleared up the word (see quotation). It is of Maori origin. Away from Maoriland "toe-rigger' had no meaning, and a false meaning and origin were given by the change of vowel. <i>(1898,Austral English,472</i>)</p>
<p><code>The bushie's favorite term of opprobrium</code>a toe-ragger' is also probably from the Maori. Amongst whom the nastiest term of contempt was that of <i>tau rika rika</i>, or slave.

The bookmakers were never named Tommies after soldiers, who are so dubbed, for when the latter lie on the field they've generally been shot at, whereas the bookie when he lays on the field, he's not been shot at, and, moreover, he never lays himself open to be shot at, either by marksmen or punters.

A tonguer was a native or white living in New Zealand who assisted a whaling crew to cut up whales and who also acted in the capacity of an interpreter. These men earned their name not from the act of interpreting, but from the fact that they were given the whale's carcase and tongue to dispose of as they wished. <i>(1941,NZ Slang,13</i>)</p>

I must not omit here Some mention of what are called tonguers. they [sic] are here 2 and 3 white people who have a boat and some natives on a ship arriving they repair on board to solicit the Job for the ship The terms are that they occasionally furnish a crew to help tow whales they furnish a boats crew to help cut the whale in and do any talking for the captain whose ignorance of the language requires their aid in any matters with the natives. When the whale is cut in they are entitled to the carcass and the tongue which in plentiful Whaling is always left on the carcass and they contrive to get for [sic] 6 to 8 barrels of oil from each carcass but they are in general Blackguards and no dependence can be put in them - Runaways from Ships Mostly.

When the whale is cut in they are entitled to the carcass &amp; the tongue which in plentiful Whaling is always left on the carcass and they contrive to get from 6 to 8 barrels of oil from each carcass but they are in general Blackguards and no dependence can be put in them - Runaways from Ships Mostly. <i>(Apr 28, 1836,Log of Mary Mitchell,39</i>)</p>

Red Birch of Wellington, Nelson, and in part of Otago and Southland. It is not so easy to see why any difficulty should have occurred in the identification of this fine timber-tree apart from the misleading tendency of the common names generally applied. The thin yet firm texture of the leaf, the prominent veins, the sharply-toothed margins, are characters that can only be confused with those afforded by a careless observer. Yet merely owing to the use of common names based upon colour, and applied or rather misapplied to the leaves, bark, or wood at the fancy of the bushman, no species has been more misunderstood. <i>Ibid.</i> 302 All the men engaged at the sawmills [of West Oxford] had heard of `tooth-leaved beech,' but only one or two of them had seen it growing, and no one had seen it converted.

<p><b>KIRK</b> With the view of obviating the confusion caused by the misuse of the common names hitherto applied to the New Zealand beeches, I would suggest the adoption of new names based on the obvious characteristics of their foliage:- For <i>Fagus fusca</i>, tooth-leaved beech; for <i>Fagus solandri</i>, entire-leaved beech; and for <i>Fagus menziesii</i>, round-leaved beech. <i>(1875,Durability NZ Timbers,17</i>)</p>
<p>The utmost confusion prevails among the common names of the birches. There are scarcely two districts, a few miles apart, in which the same name is applied to the same tree, and a similar result may be obtained by consulting two bushmen in the same bush. With a view to obviating this difficulty Mr Kirk suggests <code>the adoption of new names based of the obvious characteristics of foliage [e.g.] for Fagus fusca</code>tooth-leaved beech'; for Fagus solandri `entire-leaved beech' etc. [This is unsuitable as foliage varies] I would suggest the retention of the common Otago names Fagus fusca - Red birch ; F. solandri - Black-heart birch ; F Menziesii - Silver birch. <i>(1876,TrNZI,64/</i>) [NOTES: (Blair),]</p>

They were about three feet long and well soaked in muttonbird fat, before being set alight and were made from dry tree branches. Piles of these <code>torches' were prepared and set aside awaiting [69] the start of the</code>torching' and each family had their torch bearers.

The native, unable to purchase tobacco to the extent he formerly did, began to grow it himself, and from instructions he has contrived to pick up, he now manufactures it; this he calls <i>torore</i>; some of it is so well made that there are great smokers who will give equal weight of our best tobacco for it. <i>(1868,Past and Present of NZ,134</i>)</p>

<p>In the bush or in the open do you tramp on a <i>track</i>, a <i>trail</i>, or a <i>path</i>? Not on a path one may be sure, seldom if ever on a trail, almost always on a track, like a proper New Zealander... <i>Track</i> is undoubtedly the established word in New Zealand. It is the only one occurring on maps or applied to named routes, such as <i>Hongi's track</i>, the <i>Milford track</i>, the <i>Pahiatua Bush Track Road</i>. ..[25] It is interesting to compare the use of <i>track</i> and<i> trail</i> in <i>The Tramper</i>. Through the first volumes <i>track</i> is always used when referring to an actual track, and <i>trail</i> occurs rarely and then only in the expression <i>blazed trail</i> or more or less figuratively - <code>to fare forth on the trail'.

It is significant that it occurs in reference to Arthur's Pass for trail seems to have come into use in Canterbury in this sense before it reached Wellington. It occurs once or twice in the first volume of the <i>Canterbury Mountaineer</i>, and there is the <i>B.B. Trail </i>in the Arthur's Pass Hand book of 1935. From 1939 till 1940 in <i>The Tramper, trail </i>is used moderately frequently for an actual track, e.g. <code>an old Maori trail',</code>a miner's trail', but only by the one writer, a Wellington member of the Canterbury Mountaineering Club. <i>Trail</i> shows no sign of ousting <i>track. </i> <i>(Sep 1958,Tararua,24</i>) [NOTES: Ruth Mason `Track and Trail']</p>

<p>In recent years there seems to have been a tendency to use both <i>track</i> and<i> trail</i> and to differentiate between them. A trail seems to be something narrow and perhaps rather hard to follow - a way marked only by blazes or worn by animals, usually deer. A track seems to be something broader, cut or formed by man. ... A well-known older Club member made this distinction when, on hearing him speak of a deer trail, I asked him what he thought to be the difference between <i>track</i> and <i>trail</i>. I remarked that I thought it a very recent distinction, one not occurring in the Club until about 1957. He disagreed, believing it to be one he had always known. Yet, on looking through <i>The Tramper, </i> I could not find <i>deer trail</i> used until 1944, but <i>deer track</i> occurs from the first number in 1928 onwards, and he himself had used it in 1940. It remains to be seen whether this distinction will become established.

<p>In the bush or in the open do you tramp on a <i>track, trail</i>, or a <i>path</i>? Not on a path one may be sure, seldom if ever on a trail, almost always on a track, like a proper New Zealander. ... I well remember the shock of astonishment when in 1937 I first saw <i>trail </i>used in New Zealand. The word was on a rough signpost pointing out the beginning of White's Track at Piha. I am afraid I thought somewhat scornfully, <code>Hm, some townie who has never been out of the city or set foot off a pavement has got all his ideas of New Zealand outdoor life from reading books about North America.'...[25] It is interesting to compare the use of &lt;i&gt;track&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;trail&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;The Tramper&lt;/i&gt;. Through the first volumes &lt;i&gt;track&lt;/i&gt; is always used when referring to an actual track, and &lt;i&gt;trail &lt;/i&gt;occurs rarely and then only in the expression &lt;i&gt;blazed trail&lt;/i&gt; or more or less figuratively -</code>to fare forth on the trail'. In 1935 there is the first definite use of<i> trail</i> as a synonym for <i>track</i> in a reference to the <code>Handbook of Arthur's Pass National Park'. It is significant that it occurs in reference to Arhtur's Pass for trail seems to have come into use in Canterbury in this sense before it reached Wellington. It occurs once or twice in the first volume of the &lt;i&gt;Canterbury Mountaineer&lt;/i&gt;, and there is the &lt;i&gt;B.B. Trail&lt;/i&gt; in the Arthur's Pass Hand book of 1935. From 1939 till 1940 in &lt;i&gt;The Tramper, trail&lt;/i&gt; is used moderately frequently for an actual track, e.g.</code>an old Maori trail', <code>a miner's trail', but only by the one writer, a Wellington member of the Canterbury Mountaineering Club. &lt;i&gt;Trail&lt;/i&gt; shows no sign of ousting &lt;i&gt;track. &lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;(Sep 1958,Tararua,24&lt;/i&gt;) [NOTES: 1958 Sep Ruth Mason</code>Track and Trail' in Tararua 24]</p>
<p>In recent years there seems to have been a tendency to use both <i>track</i> and <i>trail</i> and to differentiate between them. A trail seems to be something narrow and perhaps rather hard to follow - a way marked only by blazes or worn by animals, usually deer. A track seems to be something broader, cut or formed by man. ... A well-known older Club member made this distinction when, on hearing him speak of a deer trail, I asked him what he thought to be the difference between<i> track </i>and <i>trail.</i> I remarked that I thought it a very recent distinction, one not occurring in the Club until about 1957. He disagreed, believing it to be one he had always known. Yet, on looking through <i>The Tramper</i>, I could not find <i>deer trail</i> used until 1944, but <i>deer track</i> occurs from the first number in 1928 onwards, and he himself had used it in 1940. It remains to be seen whether this distinction will become established. In the meantime <i>deer track</i> still seems to be used far more than <i>deer trail.</i> <i>(Sep 1958,Tararua,25</i>) [NOTES: 1958 Sep Ruth Mason `Track and Trail' (deer shooters')]</p>

<p><b>TURNER</b> <i>Tramping</i> and <i>tramper</i> were used colloquially in England as early as 1908 but the word seems not to have been used in the title of a tramping club until 1919 when it was used in New Zealand. <i>(1966,English Language in Aust. &amp; NZ, The,160</i>)</p>

<p><b>SUTTON-SMITH</b> By 1900 these [bucking a rider off one's back] games had faded out of regular school playground play. But out of school, we can assume that these games were still played occasionally. For example, a version of Buck Buck ... under the name Jumbucks is played today by one of New Zealand's tramping clubs (hiking clubs) in its haunts near the snowline. It is said that the hobnailed boots of the players contribute strongly to the hazards of the game. <i>(1972,Folkgames of Children,194</i>)</p>
<p><b>PICKERING</b> The first tramping club was formed in 1919 and many more followed in the twenties. A hardy lot they must have been. Heavy leather boots studded with hobnails or clinkers on the soles, `kidney-crusher' or A-frame packs, and canvas or cotton tents ... <i>(1988,Hills, The,6</i>)</p>

<p>The centralization of New Zealand traffic at Manakau [sic] would afford a reasonable prospect for the introduction of steam to Sydney.

As a New Zealander born and bred in this country I was disturbed at the unceremonious use of a word which seems to make me some sort of foreigner in my own land. ...

<p>Although it sounds Spanish, the name 'tamarillo' is another New Zealand invention. The former name 'tree tomato', was considered inappropriate for use overseas where people buying the fruits for the first time might expect them to taste like tomatoes. In 1967, orchardist Bill Thomson took the Maori word 'tama' added 'tillo' (taken from tomatillo, a complete unrelated Mexican fruit) and then (just to make the sound more mellifluous) he replaced 't' with an 'r'. Thus, 'tamarillo' was born. <i>(Apr 1991,NZ Geographic,58</i>)</p>

It's a brilliant story, New Zealand's only locally designed and mass-produced motor vehicle, the Trekka, was the brainchild of Noel Turner, a millionaire who supported Labour. The first Trekka rolled off his assembly line in Otahuhu ion 1966. It came in two colours... It had a four cylinder engine, and took 11 gallons in the tank...

<p>Turpentine - Pittosporum eugenioides. This is the largest of the mapau family; it sometimes attains a height of 40 feet, with a diameter of 24 inches. The bark is thin, and of a light colour; the leaves are silvery green, and the flowers pale yellow... The bark exudes a thick gum, and the juice of the leaves, which is somewhat similar, was formerly used by the Maoris as a perfume, but I fear it is too resinous for European tastes. <i>(1877,TrNZI,9 : 143</i>)</p>

A strip of ground about 30 yards long by four or five wide was scooped free of top soil, which was dumped on the garden nearby. It was then ploughed about ten inches deep, or according to the number of bricks required, and very well watered, which was usually done with a shovel from a tank on a sledge for even distribution, and left to soak all night. A good layer of chopped-up tussocks was then evenly spread over the top. After more watering a six-horse team was driven up and down the strip until the pug was well mixed. <i>(1943,Pure Gold,116</i>) [NOTES: [c1910, Otago]]</p>

On the other hand, some men call the blue one <i>silver </i> (rare). <i>White t.</i> includes at least two varieties, a poa and a fescue (Festuca [novae-zealandiae]).

<p><b>R. GILBERD</b> The old method of tightening the chain securing the logs to trucks is called <code>twitching', or</code>taking a twitch'. First the chain is fastened leaving it quite slack. A lever is pased through the bight and used to twist the slack up on itself. When the chain is tight enough the end of the lever is tied to the chain. A <code>chain-rack' is now used - a giant Hayes wire-strainer. It is sometimes, but improperly, called a</code>twitch'. <code>Twitch' is probably an amalgamation of</code>twist' and `hitch'. <i>(1950,Personal Communication</i>) [NOTES: Okaihau]</p>

<p><b>OGONOWSKA-COATES</b> <i>Ages of sheep. </i>Although there are many variations, the following names are usually used: A sheep is a <i>lamb</i> until weaned. After weaning a lamb is called a <i> hogget </i> until shorn. A male lamb is a <i> ram lamb </i> until castrated, then a <i> wether </i>. A female lamb is a <i> ewe lamb </i>. After shearing, a ewe or ram lamb is usually called a <i> shorn hogget </i> until cutting the first two teeth. It is then called a <i> two-tooth </i>. Some use the term two-tooth as soon as the lamb is shorn. Next year the sheep is a <i> four-tooth, then a <i> six-tooth </i> and then an <i> eight-tooth </i> or <i> full-mouthed </i> sheep. It is full-mouthed as long as the teeth remain perfect but then becomes broken-mouthed and gummy. <i>(1987,Boards, Blades &amp; Barebellies,94</i>)</p>
