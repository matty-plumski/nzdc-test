There were generally two players ... who each sought to deflect the point of the pocket knife from certain parts of the body by a flick of the hand in such a way that the blade would stick firmly into the ground. ... Every movement had to be done three times.

<blockquote>
<p>I refer to the claim that the jandal was "invented" by Maurice Yock in the mid 1950s. He may have made up the name and trademarked it, but he did not invent the footwear. The jandal, commonly known as the flip flop in the United Kingdom, the thong in Australia and mainland United States (although since the popularity of the thong swimwear/underwear, flip flop is bcoming more common in the US) and the slippah or slipper in Hawaii, has been around for thousands of years. Flip flops first appeared in the UK around 2000 years ago, most likelt brought over by the Romans, who probably got them from the Egyptians, who had them from around 3000BC. The Allied Forces took the Japanese Zori sandal (which the Japanese had been wearing for thousands of years) back to the US after World War II, and it gained popularity among California's surfers in the early 1950s. All of which happened before Yock abbreviated the name to jandal. <i>(Jul 24, 2004,Listener (New Zealand Listener),7</i>) [NOTES: John Davies, Exeter, England]</p>
<p>Jandal, like champagne, like Hoover, should never be used as a generic term. Jandals, flip-flops, thongs - they're all a ghastly sort of topless shoe hitched to the foot with a piece of rubber between big and second toes, but call a common thong a Jandal and you're in for trouble with the Napier company holding the trademark. Jandals were born in the 1950s, an adaptation of casual slip-ons worn by the Japanese team at the 1956 Olympic Games. <i>(Jan 1, 2002,Evening Post,10</i>)</p>

<p>They've been an icon of Kiwi slobbery since the '50s but in the summer of 2001, the jandal has become a hot fashion item, far removed from the grubby rubber models sported by beer-gutted blokes at barbies.... [Maurice] Yock, a New Zealand sales rep who worked for his grandfather's company, was travelling around Asia in the late '50s when he spotted a style of footwear in Japan. The "jandal" - from "Japanese sandal" - went into production in a garage in Te Papapa in 1957, and Jandals Ltd was born, a brand name specific to this country. <i>(Jan 7, 2001,Sunday Star Times,A5</i>)</p>

<p>I am intrigued by the word "japie", sometimes "jaapie" which is often used in New Zealand for South Africans. I have asked South African expatriates about the word and their theory was that it stemmed from a characteristic pronunciation of "yeah", a word they often use. Some believe it is an ironic pun on "yuppie". In Afrikaans, the name Japie is a diminutive or affectionate form of Jaap or Jacobus.. In everyday use, a japie is a dolt or simpleton. It is often used together with the word "plaas" as in "plaasjapie", which means a yokel or country bumpkin... If the word is South African in origin, "jaapie" would be the wrong spelling. The "a" as in japie is a long vowel. <i>(Mar 25, 1999,Letter,00</i>)</p>

<p><b>LYON</b> A jigger was simply a slab of white pine or rimu, axe-trimmed to a diameter of about six inches by three inches deep, and slightly thinner toward the extremity. In the end nearest the tree was bolted a forked piece of steel made by a blacksmith, which had a point or boss on the upper side. This was secured to the board by small bolts and covered with sacking. The bushman commonly cut a neat hole in the tree about level with his breast, or even higher. Into this little chamber the bushman pushed the steel head of the jigger, elevating the tail and striking his axe into the trunk, and aided by vines climbed up till he stood upright on the jigger, whose boss, or spike, pushed into the upper part of the axe cavity, made a springy and secure chopping platform. An expert man would easily cut his stance and attach his jigger in three minutes - a very much quicker method than the old style of collecting tree fern trunks and building a platform. <i>(1952,Faring South,177</i>) [NOTES: c1890]</p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>JOHNSON</b> 267 The basic principle was that joint ventures should fish stocks not already being taken by New Zealand fishermen, and not likely to be fished by them in the near future. The fishing of these stocks should require catching capacity and know-how beyond what was available in New Zealand.<i>Ibid.</i> 268 The 72-metre <i>Banshu Maru</i> No. 8 began fishing offshore waters in 1979 for a joint venture between Watties and the Japanese fishing company Taiyo, and operations like this provided some fish for local processing and built up New Zealand's offshore fish catch. <i>(2004,Hooked</i>)</p>
<p>To complicate the issue, some New Zealand fishing companies enter joint venture agreements with foreign boat and crews, often better equipped than the local fleet for catching fish such as orange roughy and oreo in deeper waters far offshore. <i>(May 11, 2002,Dominion Weekend Magazine,3</i>)</p>
<p><b>MUNRO, D.J. &amp; P.J.</b> Government eventually recognised the potential of the outer fisheries by extending influence to the 200 miles waters of New Zealand, which, incidentally, had been fished for years by foreigners, and there appeared large "Joint Venture" vessels, owned an operated by foreign and local firms, which, so locals aver, occasionally intrude into the local fish stocks inside the zones. <i>(1984,History of Port Chalmers Fishermen's Co-operative,16</i>)</p>

<p><b>REED</b> The gum-spear, a slender, rapier-like instrument, fitted with an ordinary spade handle, varied in length from about three feet for use in shallow ground, to twenty-five or more for working deep swamps. Some time after its introduction, the spear came to be fitted with what was called the <code>joker,' or</code>toggle'. This was a coil of fine wire, bound round the spear [50] a few inches from the point. It allowed the spear to be thrust into the ground with the minimum of resistance, there being no <code>drag' on the shaft. It is said that the forerunner of the</code>joker' was discovered by accident. A digger, pushing his spear into the ground, found that it had penetrated a boot-eyelet, and was surprised to find that, instead of forming an obstruction, the spear penetrated the ground more easily; the coil of fine wire was devised as an improvement. An experienced digger could detect at once, by the feel, and the resistance met by the spear, whether he had struck timber, a stone or gum. <i>(1972,Gumdiggers, The,49</i>)</p>

<p>Judas goats are proving a strong ally in DOC's quest to remove feral goats from areas of conservation land in the Wellington region. In a first for Wellington Conservancy, goats fitted with tracking devices were released into Pukaha Mount Bruce and parts of Tararua Forest Park to sek out goats which have eluded DOC goat hunters and their dogs... Since the operation began late last year seven judas goats have tracked down 14 wild goats in the western Tararuas... <i>(May 2004,Footnotes,No. 21/11</i>)</p>
<p>The 'Judas' goat is fitted with a collar that has an antenna attached. It is then lowered into the forest by helicopter and because goats are social animals the Judas goat will find other goats. Later, the hunters' [sic] return by helicopter to the area and, using radio equipment, locate the Judas goat by picking up the signal from its antenna. The helicopter drops a hunter and dog on the ground to track the goats and shoot them. <i>(Dec 2001,Elements,13 : 4</i>)</p>
