<p><b>HARRISON</b> In September 1948 the Club appointedmeasurers to the dinghy racing classes asfollows: Peter Lamb to the I Class(Idlealong). <i>(1991,Ebb &amp; Flow,77</i>)</p>
<p><b>CARTER</b> Less than ten years ago Mr. Alf Harvey,of Wellington, conducted a series ofexperiments in an effort to evolve asuitable small class racer, and theresults of his efforts are seen today inthe ever-increasing fleet of Idle Alongcraft... The boats are of a restrictedtype and measure 12.8 feet overall, andhave a beam of approximately 6 feet. Theyare built on the square chine principle,with a good rise in floor forward ofamidships, which flattens out to a broadtuck stern. The original model was gunterrigged, but it was found.. the boatsperform better with a Bermudian rig. <i>(1948,Little Ships: NZ's Yachting Fleet,13</i>)</p>
<p><b>MANDER &amp; O'NEILL</b> A chap called Alf Harvey, from Petone,came along in the early 1930s and built aboat he named Idle Along which, becauseof its beam and stability and roominess,appealed to a great number of people.Here was the middleman's boat. Ibid. 62The Idle Along was hard-chined like the Zclass and much bigger than the two inchesdifference in length would lead one toimagine. <i>(1964,Give a Man a Boat,21</i>)</p>
<p><b>TICHENER</b> The Idle Along class thrived in the late1940s and 1950s, but in common with otherclasses such as the Z and X, the changeto plywood construction was left toolate. The class slowly declined andfinally died in the late 1960s. <i>(1978,Little Ships of NZ,72</i>)</p>
<p><b>DYSON</b> The Idle Along was designed before WordWar II to suit the blustery conditions ofWellington. <i>(Sep 1966,Yachting the NZ Way,159</i>)</p>

<p><b>DEANS</b> James Deans for many years carried a very successful flock of inbred half-bred sheep, now dispersed.

<p><b>KERR</b> The Conference of Agricultural and Pastoral Associations in 1902 agreed that this 'in-bred half-bred' should be called Corriedale in deference to Webster whose property was its birthplace. <i>(1976,From the Beginning: chronicles of a county,135</i>)</p>

Anyone - the runholder included - could buy the freehold of all or any part of a run at any time to establish a farm. However, some protection for runholders was essential, for they could not be expected to improve their runs if the land and improvements were in danger of being freeholdedwithout warning by an outside buyer. Runholders were able to register with the Provincial Council improvements such as buildings, plantations, fencing, and yards, for which they were granted [246] an improvement pre-emptive right (I.P.R.) covering fifty acres of land surrounding the improvement. A homestead pre-emptive right (H.P.R.), which afforded protection for 250 acres, could also be registered. <i>(1981,Station Years,245</i>)</p>

<p><b>SHORTLAND</b> And it seems probable that the term Waka (canoe), which is used to denote these primarydivisions, has reference to this origin of the tribes. At the present day, these Waka are divided into many distinct Iwi; each of which is subdivided again into Hapu, or smaller communities. <i>(Aug 15, 1843,Letter,305,1856 ed.</i>) [NOTES: Shortland letter in Shortland Traditions and Superstitions]</p>
<p><b>SHORTLAND</b> The term Iwi, commonly translated Tribe, applies also to those primary divisions, but more generally to their larger subdivisions: smaller subdivisions being called Hapu. <i>(1856,Traditions &amp; Superstitions,223</i>)</p>
<p><b>MANING</b> [He was the] recognised war chief of almost all the sections of the hapu of a very numerous and warlike iwi or tribe ... <i>(1863,Old New Zealand,(xiv) 215</i>)</p>
<p><b>TREGEAR</b> Names of tribes (iwi) were generally denoted by the prefix Ngati, meaning `descendants of', as Ngati-Raukawa the descendants of Raukawa. Sometimes sub-tribes (hapu) or [162] small remnants of tribes used Ngati before their names. The prefix varied into Ati and Ngai as Te Ati-awa, Ngai-tahu. <i>(1904,Maori Race, The,161</i>)</p>
<p>hapu[u], a sub-tribe (a tribe, or people, being iwi). <i>(1946,Journal of the Polynesian Society,55/149</i>)</p>
<p><b>BUCK</b> The smallest sociological unit is the biological family, which the Maoris termed whanau, derived from whanau, to give birth . ... The term hapu (pregnancy) was used to denote this expandedfamily group for it expressed the idea of birth from common ancestors ... The term iwi (bone) was brought into current use to include all the hapu descended from common ancestors and thusrelated to each other by a blood tie. To denote the groupings in English, the iwi has been termed tribe and the hapu a sub-tribe. <i>(1949,Coming of the Maori, The,333</i>)</p>
<p>We're a nation of casual racists. Joke in a newspaper not so long ago: "Does 'iwi' stand for 'I want it'?" <i>(Oct 11, 2003,Listener (New Zealand Listener),94</i>)</p>

<p>Iwi means more than merely a tribe, or a people, or a nation. It means a group of beings that, having the same physical shape and attributes, have also the same mental or instinctive qualities and acommon all-pervading unity of disposition. <i>(Jan 12, 1922,Auckland Weekly News,14</i>)</p>

<p><i>n.</i> (Environment) a conservation levy on commercial fishing and usage of some rivers and lakes, proposed by iwi owners.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An iwi tax is a second mini-Treaty settlement (March 6). Any cost to commercial fishermen is naturally tax-deductible, thus lessening the tax take. Taxpayers will have to make this up in some other way. <i>(Mar 14, 2009,Dominion Post,B4</i>)</p>
<p>It's obvious that the government doesn't have a problem with the iwi tax being levied on commercial use of Lake Ellesmere (March 6) and this attitude indicates there won't be much in the way of accountability for the revenue. <i>(Mar 14, 2009,Dominion Post,B4</i>)</p>
<p>Commercial users of the Waikato River should prepare themselves for an "iwi tax" after Ngai Tahu imposed a conservation levy on eel fishermen at Lake Ellesmere in the South Island. Mr Smith described the levy as the forerunner to a new nationwide iwi tax system after his group of eel fishermen were asked to contribute $29,000, or 8 per cent of the total annual eel fishery earnings of $360,000, to Ngai Tahu for Lake Ellesmere environmental restoration purposes. The iwi also receives revenue for leasing out its quota. <i>(Mar 6, 2009,Internet - see Notes,1</i>) [NOTES: www.stuff.co.nz/waikato-times/news/2011399/Iwi-tax-fears-for-Waikato-River]</p>
