<p>A New Zealander's "Mana" is his "Rangatiratanga"; that is, his Influence, or his Respectability. <i>(Jun 5, 1860,Daily Southern Cross,3</i>)</p>

<p>Rangatiratanga is a collective concept. You can't sell your rangatiratanga. In the Treaty of Waitangi, the word "rangatiratanga" appears in article 2.

Kawanatanga is subject to a promise to protect Rangatiratanga. Rangatiratanga is subject to an acknowledgment of Kawanatanga. The working out in practice of the balance between the two Articles must depend upon a case by case consideration. ... It is the right of all citizens, Maori, Pakeha, and other New Zealanders, that there be effective Government or Kawanatanga in such matters. <i>(1989,Principles for Crown Action,7</i>)</p>
<p>More insidiously, the actual terms of the treaty such as "rangatiratanga" and "full and exclusive possession" are being redefined to proscribe Maori rights. <i>(Nov 19, 1988,Listener (New Zealand Listener),16</i>)</p>

<p>From the air, Rangitoto's 258 m high sunmmit looks more like a green poached egg than a rugged volcanic cone. Molten lava spewed from around the crater as recently as 600 years ago and plenty of raw rock is still visible between the clumps of encroaching trees. While the eruptions left Rangitoto with a black and scaly skin, ash deposited on neighbouring Motutapu Island.. smoothed the topography and endowed it with up to two metres of rich topsoil. <i>Ibid.</i> 24 ...[Tamatekapua's] fate endures in the island's full name - "Te Rangi I Totongia A Tametakapua" or "the day the blood of Tametekapua was shed"...

<p><b>KIRK</b> It is invariably erect and never climbing, although bushmen and settlers frequently state that it climbs the loftiest trees, and sooner or later squeezes them to death in its iron clasp. In proof of this they assert that, when felling huge ratas, they often find a dead tree in the centre of the rata: this is a common occurrence, but it by no means follows that this species is a climber. The error is simply due to imperfect observation, which has led careless observers to confuse [<i>M. scandens</i> the Aka], which is a true climber with <i>M. robusta</i>. <i>(1889,Forest Flora,263</i>)</p>
<p><b>MORRIS</b> <i>Rata, n.</i> Maori name for two New Zealand erect or sub-scandent flowering trees, often embracing trunks of forest trees and strangling them: the Northern Rata, <i> Metrosideros robusta </i> , A. Cunn., and the Southern Rata, <i> M. lucida </i> , Menz., both of the N.O. <i> Myrtacea </i> . The tree called by the Maoris Aka, which is another species of <i> Metrosideros (M. florida)</i> , is also often confused with the Rata by bushmen and settlers. In Maori, the adj. <i> rata </i> means red-hot, and there may be a reference to the scarlet appearance of the flower in full bloom. The timber of the Rata is often known as <i> Ironwood </i> , or <i> Ironbark </i> . The trees rise to sixty feet in height; they generally begin by trailing downwards from the seed deposited on the bark of some other tree near its top. When the trailing branches reach the ground they take root there and sprout erect. For full account of the habit of the trees, see quotation 1867 (Hochstetter), 1879 (Moseley), and 1889 (Kirk). <i>(1898,Austral English,380</i>)</p>

Actually there are two species' Sonchus oleraceus, whose lobed leaves are only mildly prickly and flat, or at the most very slightly waved at the edges, and S. asper, very similar except that the leaves are much more prickly, and are waved or crimped around the edges. The flowers are yellow, rather like those of a dandelion, about three-quarters of an inch in diameter. &lt;i&gt; Chewing Gum &lt;/i&gt; According to some people, rauriki is the Maori name of the former and puwha of the latter, but I do not know that the Maoris went in for such nice distinctions. Different tribes had different names for the same thing. Puwha, as well as being one of the names for the sow thistle, seems to have been also used sometimes as a general term for any cooked greens, of which sow thistle was the favourite. &lt;i&gt;(Jan 7, 1963,Otago Star&lt;/i&gt;) [NOTES: (I.W.T.

<p>At Oxford, Makereti (Maggie Papakura) wrote: `I myself gather the sow thistle here and cook it to eat, as it reminds me of our own puwha, of which I am very fond. Puwha was used only as a vegetable ... The succulent stems contained a bitter milky juice which came to the surface when the flower tops were plucked off. This was left, on a sunny day, for a few hours, then gathered between the thumb and first finger, adding the thick creamy mass of several plants together. This was used as a sort of chewing gum, called pia or ngau, which tasted very bitter at first. But after a little chewing, the bitterness disappeared, and this gum was much enjoyed, especially by the women, who vied with each other in seeing who could make her pia crack the loudest.' <i>(Jan 7, 1963,Otago Star</i>)</p>

<p>On the West Coast the miners Federation changed its name to New Zealand Federation of Labour (soon known as the red Federation, or simply the Red Fed) and sent out organisers to win support from other unions. <i>(1993,Wharfie,p28</i>)</p>
<p><b>HICKEY</b> ... I issued a circular, stating that the Federation would stand behind the tramwaymen in any action that they might take. I had no authority whatever for issuing the circular, and in looking back on that time now, can only account for my impetuous action through my anger at the contempt displayed towards organised Labour by the City Council and the press. The leaflet (which happened to be printed on red paper, this giving the idea to the <code>Evening Post' [in early 1912] that was responsible for the coining of the term</code>Red Federation,' which was afterwards abbreviated to `Red Fed.') caused a wave of militancy to sweep through the tramway service, and a meeting was called for the p.m. shift the following day. <i>(1925,Red Fed.

The maid came from Stirling, and the family always thought it was one of her home-town expressions, so when Alison got to New Zealand, she was surprised to hear it being used in the same context of finality. "The whole rick-ma-tick" has a long and honourable history as a Scottish version of "the whole kit and caboodle", an expression from the United States east coast that is widely understood here as an ornate alternative to "the whole lot". <i>(Mar 19, 2003,Dominion Post,B7</i>)</p>

<p><i>n.</i> a groundwater crustacean [ORIGIN: Maori, The name <i>Ringanui</i> is derived from the Maori words <i>ringa</i> (hand) and <i>nui</i> (big) in reference to the very large gnathopod 1 characteristic of this genus. <strong>The name <i>toonuiiti</i> is derived from Maori <i>toonui</i> (thumb) and <i>iti</i> (little) and refers to the smaller robust seta defining the proximal end of the gnathopod 1 palm... </strong>The name <i>koonuiroa</i> is derived from Maori <i>koonui</i> (thumb) and <i>roa</i> (long) and refers to the very large robust seta defining the proximal end of the gnathopod 1 palm...]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The new genus, Ringanui, is a significant step in resolving this confusion. Ringanui differs from Paraleptamphopus on several characters and is most easily recognised by diverse gnathopods, the first of which is enlarged relative to gnathopod 2. The two species are described and illustrated in detail. They differ in size and gnathopod characteristics, but other differences are small. Ringanui koonuiroa is the smaller species and is most easily recognised by the single, very long robust seta defining the palm of gnathopod 1. The second species, R. toonuiiti, is the larger, but its palmar defining spine is relatively short. <i>(2006,Internet - see Notes</i>) [NOTES: http://www.mapress.com/zootaxa/2006f/z01148p025f.pdf Accessed on 14/03 2006]</p>

This was probably for the intense orange of the flowers... In its home in California, great sweeps of egg-yolk gold against the blue leaves are breathtaking. Since the rotten egg has become a darling of the landscape designer, several colours have evolved, including pink, a near brown, and a beautiful soft clotted-cream that comes true from seed year after year. <i>(Jun 4, 1999,Dominion,12</i>)</p>

<p>Run.- The pioneers of sheep farming in New Zealand and Australia came from various classes; but there were few among them who had been sheep farmers before and fewer still who were scientists. If they had been sheep farmers they would probably have used the English or Scotch sheep farming words (as they did to some extent) and fitted them to the new conditions. If they had been scientists they would have invented exact names for everything new, and translated them into Latin. What they did do was to take the handiest word they could think of and give it a new meaning, As time went on the word they had chosen changed or extended its meaning. The best example of all this is the word run. <i>(Nov 18, 1933,Press, The,15</i>) [NOTES: &gt;Acland's senses 1 and 5 seem to be the central ones, with the others being specialisations of, or obvious inferences from those. --&gt;cf also Morris]</p>

<p><b>MORRIS</b> Run, n. (1) Tract of land over which sheep or cattle may graze. It is curious that what in England is called a sheep-walk, in Australia is a sheep-run. In the Western United States it is a sheep -ranch. Originally the squatter, or sheep-farmer, did not own the land. It was unfenced, and he simply had the right of grazing or `running' his sheep or cattle on it. Subsequently, in many cases, he purchased the freehold, and the word is now applied to a large station- property, fenced or unfenced. (See quotation, 1883.) [1826] <i>(1898,Austral English,397</i>)</p>
<p><b>TURNER</b> First a run is a parcel of land as leased. A sheepfarmer might own several adjacent runs of land, in this sense, and the whole <code>station' so formed might also be termed a run. In the third sense a run was leasehold as opposed to freehold land; in a fourth sense, open land as opposed to fenced land. It might be used as an adjective, e.g. run cattle. It might be the equivalent of station but without including the sheep, i.e.</code>He sold his run' need not imply that he sold his sheep, but `He sold his station' would. <i>(1966,English Language in Aust. &amp; NZ, The,50</i>)</p>
<p>run: [1] This word has several uses but the most common refers to a stretch of work. The official shearing time of two hours is called a <code>run'. The day is divided into four of these. 7.30am-9.30am, smoke-o; 10.00am-12 noon, dinner; 1.00pm-3.00pm smoke-o; 3.30pm-5.30pm, tea. [2] Also another name for a sheep station. [3] Also the contract circuit. A shearing contractor will arrange a</code>run' of sheds for his gang each season. <i>(1989,NZ English Newsletter,3/27</i>) [NOTES: (Wallace Shearing Glossary)]</p>

<p>At the same time (c 1870s) the rusticated weatherboard made its appearance - the invention of it being attributed to Toxwood, who was an artichtect [sic] trained in Denmark. . . In the days of the wooden rusticated house.. the wealth of the fortunate owner was reflected in the character and elaboration of the external adornment. <i>Ibid.</i> 21 The plain rusticated wall with stops was the lowest degree; if quoins were mitred at the corners that was an indication of greater refinement; but for the highest type and the wealthier client the quoins must be ovolo molded. <i>(Apr 1935,NZ Inst. Arch. Journal,20</i>)</p>

<p><b>SALMOND</b> Another kind of weatherboard which became popular in the 1880's was the "rusticated" board, where the top edge was planed down to fit behind a rebate in the edge of the next board. The completed wall showed pronounced grooves which resembled channel-jointed stonework, and in more elaborate houses timber <i>quoins</i> at corners assisted the illusion. The introduction of the rusticated board has been attributed to the Wellington architect Julius Toxward in the 1860s. <i>(1986,Old New Zealand Houses,114</i>)</p>
<p>rusticated or rusticating n. (in New Zealand) a wide type of weatherboarding used in older houses. <i>(1982,Collins Concise English Dictionary,1013</i>) [NOTES: [nf. 1986 NZPOD; 1985 Collins NZ Compact Dict. 427]]</p>

<p>After lunch, the Professor tested some specimens submitted to him by local men, and amongst other things showed the method of cleaning rusty gold. <i>(Apr 24, 1886,West Coast Times,2</i>)</p>
<p>Prior to the floods the indications were such that the directors and shareholders fully believed that the dredge was about to realise expectations. For the few hours that she was on the first bottom, coarse, rusty gold, characteristic of that particular place, was got, but the river rose again, and another opportunity did not occur. <i>(Aug 7, 1901,Otago Witness,25</i>)</p>

<p>Labour leader Helen Clark is questioning the appointment of one of the "high priests of Rogernomics and Ruthanasia" as the new head of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. <i>(Oct 13, 1998,Dominion,1</i>)</p>
<p>The leader, deputy and a handful of others are queasy about the Ruthanasia era. Who isn't? <i>(Sep 14, 2002,Listener (New Zealand Listener),17</i>)</p>
<p>They speak of a time before Rogernomics and Ruthanasia, when issues were clear-cut, and people still cared enough to put their bodies on the line for something bigger than themselves. <i>(Sep 13, 1996,Independent (Auckland),18</i>)</p>
<p>In 2002, Colin James argued that Helen Clark's government was operating during a period of consolidation, smoothing out some of the most glaring social inequalities created by the 1984-92 policy revolution, while consolidating the key economic changes of Rogernomics and Ruthanasia. <i>(Sep 11, 2005,NZ Herald,Herald on Sunday 4</i>)</p>
<p>And for most of us, those sensual childhood delights intensify and deepen with age. "Let's go into the garden" becomes a universal cry from the heart that can be heard more often as the economic climate worsens and Ruthanasia (Mary Varnham's delightful term) rampages in the wake of Rogernomics unrelieved by shafts of light or the chiaroscuro effects to be found in the personal Eden of the garden. <i>(Sep 21, 2003,Listener (New Zealand Listener),79</i>)</p>
