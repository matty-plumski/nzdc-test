<p><b>GRADY</b> As well as superstitions, the whalers of Tory Channel had a few time-honoured habits. One of these was known as <code>a-day-for-the-Queen'. Its main application seems to have been when a whaler had had a heavy day on the grog and had butterflies in his stomach and head the nextday in the form of a hangover. If, for example, a harpoon-gunner like Trevor Norton was to have</code>a-day-for-the-Queen', he would be on a kind of half-alert. After a solid day on the booze he might find a nice, quiet bunk on board the Perano mother ship Tuatea, where he could nestle down rather than being on lookout duty up on the hill. <i>(1982,Perano Whalers,140</i>)</p>

<p>In recent years there seems to have been a tendency to use both track and trail and to differentiate between them. A trail seems to be something narrow and perhaps rather hardto follow - a way marked only by blazes or worn by animals, usually deer. A track seems to be something broader, cut or formed by man. ... A well-known older Club member made this distinction when, on hearing him speak of a deer trail, I asked him what he thought to be the difference between track and trail. I remarked that I thought it a very recent distinction, one not occurring in the Club until about 1957. He disagreed, believing it to be one he had always known. Yet, on looking through The Tramper, I could not find deer trail used until 1944, but deer track occurs from the first number in 1928 onwards, and he himself had used it in 1940. It remains to be seen whether this distinction will become established.

<p>When the selection [of the N.Z. Company share of the Otago Block] had been made the Crowngrant was to be issued, and there was an understanding that if Colonel Wakefield desired stillmore land he was to have it. This was the origin of what was afterwards known as thedepasturage licences, under which settlers were authorised to run cattle and sheep in the adjoining districts. <i>Ibid.</i> 138-139 Under the original terms, land purchasers were entitled upon payment of an annual license fee of 10s. 6d. to depasture or run sheep and cattle upon such waste lands within the block as remained unappropriated. ... though Captain Cargill was then gazetted Commissioner of Crown Lands for the Otago block only, he received no definite instructions upon the subject of granting the runs. [139] The result was that he merely filed the applications for depasturage licenses as they were presented to him, whilst the applicants were left to pursue their further course as seemed best to them. <i>(1898,Contributions to the Early History of New Zealand,59</i>)</p>

<p>The common method of addressing a New Zealander is to call him "digger," which, from being an abusive term, has been readily and universally adopted and approved by the Pig Islanders themselves. We, the N.Z.R.B., prefer to be addressed as "diggers" rather than "dinks" which was the original mode of address. <i>(Apr 30, 1918,Wanganui Chronicle,4</i>) [NOTES: From a letter by Rifleman C A Palmer of Wanganui (nb: date entered in NZDE database was 31/4/1918)]</p>
<p>"Digger" is now the common form of salutation between privates. It applied to the Maoris only at one time. They do a lot of pioneer work, such as digging trenches, but as we all do more or less navvy work, the term is universally used among the New Zealanders. Really the meaning is "Friend" now. <i>(Aug 13, 1917,Wanganui Herald,6</i>) [NOTES: This is from a letter from an Auckland soldier;]</p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>BOWMAN</b> During the [1890] strike about 100 seamen unattached in Port Chalmers stayed in hotels and boarding houses, but a large number of them found residence in the "baches" in what was called "Sweat Rag Alley", consisting of a number of small baches or cribs in a double row where the Corporation Yard now is. Each bach housed three or four men and it was said that each man had a dog. From this fact, the area became known as "Dogtown". <i>(1948,Port Chalmers,53</i>)</p>
<p>To the uninitiated this may mean nothing, but, to those in the know, the quickest way to cause a riot and to raise an insurrection is to call an inhabitant of Port Chalmers a dweller in Dogtown. <i>(Jul 8, 1911,NZ Truth,315/7/1</i>)</p>
<p><b>CRYER</b> There are two explanations for the term Dog Town. The first has its clue in the name of the town, Port Chalmers, which obviously had a lot of docks. As with the Isle of Dogs in London, there is a belief that in the old days the docks of Port Chalmers caused it to be referred to as Dock Town, and the word became corrupted. But there are also legends that.. there were always many seamen about, sometimes unemployed, and all of them were accompanied by their dogs. Most of these men lived in cottages in George Street which became known locally as Dog Town and the name spread to mean Port Chalmers in general. It's occasionally heard even today. <i>(2001,Curious Questions,63</i>)</p>
<p><b>STEWART</b> And during the troubles [sc. an 1890 strike] , about 100 seamen from other ports stayed in baches in an area called 'Sweat Rag Alley' in Port Chalmers.

Light posts (about 3 ft. 6 in. in height) are arranged in pairs, crosswise, so as to form a fork about 18 in. from the top.

<p>The dog-leg fence, found in North America only in the Maritime Provinces of Canada, reappeared in the Nova Scotian settlement at Waipu, and from there spread to some other bush settlements in the north. It was constructed by driving two crossing stakes into the ground, and in the notch of these placing a third rail which followed the direction of the fence ... It was claimed that it would keep out cattle, but the fence was never widely adopted probably because of its tendency to get out of repair easily. <i>(Oct 1965,NZ Geographer,147</i>) [NOTES: (Hargreaves `Farm Fences')]</p>

<p>The known deficiency diseases in New Zealand apparently mainly due to the lack of some element in the food of farm animals are:- <code>Bush Sickness' or [mistakenly] Iron deficiency.</code>Dopiness' or Calcium deficiency. <code>Waihi Disease' or Phosphate deficiency.</code>Goitre' or Iodine deficiency... Bush sickness is always found in the volcanic district on coarse rhyolitic pumice soils and <code>dopiness' on soils derived from fine volcanic dust or mud showers. A soil on which</code>dopiness' develops is a leached loam and is found on deteriorated lands, i.e., lands which originally were highly fertile due to the ashes from the `bush burn,' the land subsequently becoming gradually less productive ... <i>(1936,Agricultural Organization in NZ,81</i>)</p>
<p>It is at lambing-time that the effect of grass-grub ravages is most severe. Ewes are low in condition and have missed the <code>green bite from the pastures ... The normal green-feed area ... is inadequate. The result is a high mortality in young lambs, an increased susceptibility of the ewe to</code>dopiness,' ... <i>(1943,NZ Journal of Science &amp; Technology,23/323A</i>)</p>

<p><b>McARA</b> The term driving generally referred to tunnelling in any direction but in some circumstances, where reefs were present, it meant tunnelling along the line of the reef or parallel to it. The term drifting was used more specifically for driving on a reef, while the term crosscutting referredto tunnelling across the reef up to an angle of say forty-five degrees; however it was common to talk of `driving a crosscut'. <i>(1978,Gold Mining at Waihi,184</i>)</p>

<p>Often it is necessary to construct costly dams to impound the water in the upper parts of the creek, in order that it may be suddenly liberated ... so that the entire assemblage [332] of [kauri] logs may be <code>driven' to the booms. In dry seasons the logs may remain in the bed of the creek for months, and, occasionally, after a successful</code>drive', the harvest of logs is carried out to sea and lost, through the booms breaking from the immense pressure behind them. <i>(1894,NZ Official Yearbook,331</i>) [NOTES: (T.

He was [87 years old.] Dr Dye was born in Driffield, Yorkshire, and educated at Bridlington School and Leeds University from which he graduated in 1925 as a Doctor of Science. He came to New Zealand in 1929 to be a lecturer at the newly-founded Massey Agricultural College. Shortly after his arrival Dr Dry discovered a ram lamb in a flock near Palmerston North which had an extremely hairy fleece due to an abundance of halo-hairs. Dr Dry's successful efforts to isolate the gene in Romney led to the development of the Drysdale. Dr Dry devoted nearly 40 years studying the genetic makeup of the fleece of the sheep and published many papers. He retired from Massey University in 1956 as Professor of Animal Genetics but continued his interest in the Drysdale till his death. <i>(Jul 17, 1979,Dominion,5/1</i>)</p>
