<p>It may be remarked that National Park is American in origin, dating from 1872, about the time that Yosemite was set aside for recreational purposes. In England, park, like forest, may have a definite legal meaning when it applies to a tract of land held by royal grant for keeping beasts of the chase. Unlike a forest, a park is enclosed, and [31] it does not have special laws or offices. In all the uses to which park has been put in England, until the recent adoption of National Park, there has been the idea of enclosure, as there is in the cognate paddock. The term forest park, as in the Tararua Forest Park, would once have seemed a contradiction in terms. <i>(Sep 1958,Tararua,30</i>) [NOTES: Ruth Mason `Track and Trail']</p>

<p><i>adj.</i> Used within New Zealand, in competition with the more specific New Zealand, Maori to denote especially fauna (including human fauna) and flora considered indigenous. It is now (1984) anobsolescent or non-preferred use, chiefly because of the felt derogatory application to people and things Maori (cf the change in 1947 from Department of <code>Native Affairs' to</code>Maori Affairs', and such shifts as native earth oven amended to earth oven between the sixth (1957) and seventh (1971) editions of Williams Dictionary (Umu 1 p467); and also of greater feeling of identity among born New Zealanders expressing itself in a more specific descriptive term <code>New Zealand'. (Shifts such as native bush to indigenous forest are an example of vernacular or common as against technical or</code>professional' forestry usage: the latter being the converse of exotic forest.) The New Zealand non-specificity of native can be seen in its Australian applications (see Morris), and is illustrated by OED 13c. <code>In the names of Australian animals and birds in the names of Australian plants, fruits, etc.' [J.A. Andersen's comments (</code>Popular Names of New Zealand Plants': 1926 Tr NZI 662) still hold: <code>The word</code>native' has been prefixed to almost as many names as the words <code>New Zealand .... This word may perhaps be descriptive if used within New Zealand and between New Zealanders; but if used outside - say in Australia - its meaning will be quite changed; for should the New Zealander speak of</code>native teak' the Australian would think not of a New Zealand but of an Australian tree. The confusion might be avoided were the word <code>Maori' used instead of the word</code>native', and indeed, instead of the long double `New Zealand'. See also 1933 Acland's note on indigenous.

<p><i>n.</i> [A small round short-pastry tart with a custard filling but especially characterised by the icing, half of which is black and half white; in Dunedin with a peppermint flavour (check). Other variations in the filling include lemon juice, rum essence or vanilla. Known to me from Dunedin in 1952. An Australian version (see below) is on a biscuit base instead of being in a tart and includes a layer of jam but has the essential bicoloured icing. Possible origins of the name : Nimes (in France); Neen in Shropshire (Neenton, Neen Savage, Neen Sollars); have been told of a Dutch woman making them. There is an outside chance it might be related to the neem tree ("a meliaceous tree of India and Ceylon, sometimes 50 feet high... The natives chew its small twigs and use them as tooth brushes") but I think not. David Burton does not mention them in his books on the raj. Kathryn Walls knows the lemon-flavoured variety from Invercargill (thought they were bakery rather than home-made), Vincent had heard of them, Bill Manhire hadn't. Nelson Wattie does not know them from NZ but when the bicoloured icing was described said he knew them from Germany as "Americans", possibly because of the black and white racial suggestion. Tony Simpson makes, them, his mother made them, his grandmother made them, but he doesn't know anything about the origin. The name appears as a headword in the Macquarie Dictionary but none other that I can find. None of the books on the cookery shelves at National Library has them, not do any of the present stock of second-hand ones in Quilter's but then most modern cookery books are written (or compiled) by restaurant chefs who do not bake and not by bakery cooks.]</p>

<p>I am - a New Chum. My business is to critcise, moralise upon, compare, sketch, and, where necessary, correct or praise the peculiarities of my adopted countrymen. First, then, arises this question: what is a 'New Chum'? and it may be answered in two ways, according to the manner in which it is asked. For there is a real New Chum; and there is a New Chum that is ideal only. The New Chum proper, is, I understand, a person who has but freshly come to the Colony from some part or other of the old world. The New chum that most colonists, here, appear to have in their mind's eye, is quite a different being in most cases. He is a pattern of neatness and elegance in his dress; of cheek and superciliousness in his deportment; of ignorance, meanness, cowardice, spiritlessness, vagueness, helplessness in time of emergency, vanity, presumption, and emptiness, in his temperament; and of all these vices, combined with effeminate and pedantic precision, in his talk. His delight is to abuse colonial customs; to run down the local 'bigwigs'; to show contempt for the industries and pursuits of the colonists generally; and affect a languid indifference to the matters which most engage their interest. His purse is even emptier than his head. He is without resources and without pluck. His ambition is at once low and unreasonable. he puts his trust in letters of introduction, and looks for a Government billet. <i>(Aug 30, 1871,Timaru Herald,6</i>)</p>

<p>New Zealand is divided into two provinces, New Ulster, and New Munster, each of which is under a Lieutenant-Governor, who enacts ordinances for the province over which he presides, with the advice of a Legislative Council, composed of the officers of Government, together with a few persons nominated by the crown from amongst the inhabitants. A Governor-in-Chief rules the whole of New Zealand and is assisted in his legislation by a Council constituted similarly to the provincial Councils. At present, the Governor-in-Chief holds the subordinate office of Lieutenant-Governor of New Ulster , in addition to his higher Commission: and Mr Eyre is the Lieutenant of New Munster, the southern province. <i>(Feb 1, 1851,Lyttelton Times,2</i>)</p>
<p><b>THOMSON</b> Of the three islands forming the Zealand group, Rakiura, or the small South Island, is the only one which possesses a native name. Since the days of Cook, the North Island has been named on old maps Eaheinomawe, and the Middle Island Tavai-poenammo. These names originated thus. When the great navigator asked the natives the name of the North Island, he was told that it was <code>a thing fished from the sea by Maui,' - He mea hi no Maui; and that the Middle Island was Te wahi pounamu, or</code>the place of the greenstone.' When New Zealand became a British colony, the first governor, who was an Irishman, proclaimed that the North, Middle, and South Island were thenceforth to be denominated respectively New Ulster, New Munster, and New Leinster; and these names he selected for the colony because New Zealand, like Irelands, had no toads. This modern method of naming places by applying the epithet `New' to countries which are as old as the originals is not only incorrect, but possesses many disadvantages. The Constitution Act of 1852 discarded this unsuitable nomenclature, and the North, Middle, and Stewart's Islands are the names now invariably given to them by the settlers, and those by which they are familiar toseamen. The South Island was named in honour of the sealer who, in 1808, discovered its insularity. Sentimental settlers designate New Zealand the Britain of the southern hemisphere, on the same principle that the Dutchman Tasman, who discovered the country, called it New Zealand. <i>(1859,Story of New Zealand, The,1/4</i>)</p>

<p><code>The name Aotearoa was made popular around 1898 with the publication of William Pember Reeves' book The Long White Cloud - Aotearoa,' historian ... Sir Keith Sinclair says. After 1870, most Maori referred to the country as Niu Tirani - a result of Pakeha settlers calling the three islands New Zealand. Sir Keith said that in all the written Maori he had read from last century the word Aotearoa had been used in only one newspaper. Te Wanaanga, published in Napier, used Aotearoa in the 1870s. Sir Keith said Maori often referred to New Zealand by using</code>te motu nei' (in this island). Sir Keith said the literal translation of Aotearoa was `land of the long twilight'. The name may have come about because the early Polynesians were not used to the long evenings in New Zealand. <i>(Jul 17, 1988,Sunday Star Times,A6</i>)</p>

<p>The New Zealand Alliance Convention opened to-day, Mr Wesley Spragg (Auckland), president, in the chair. The report presented stated that the outbreak of war injuriously affected campaign work and the vote for prohibition and no-license. Approval was expressed of the refusal of the Government to allow wet canteens at Expeditionary Force camps. <i>(Apr 14, 1915,Ashburton Guardian,2</i>)</p>
<p>The liquor traffic, in the "Evening Post" of October 11, and in other papers, challenges the New Zealand Alliance to produce "any evidence that the American people have ever voted or had an opportunity of voting upon the question of National Prohibition." <i>(Oct 21, 1922,NZ Truth,10</i>)</p>
<p>Government acted thus, because after making a count they found that the publicans had more noses in the House than the teetotallers; and the object of the New Zealand Alliance for the Reform of the liquor laws was to let Mr Sheehan and those of his sort see that the teetotallers had as many noses in the House as the publicans. <i>(Mar 25, 1879,Bruce Herald,5</i>)</p>
<p>At the annual public meeting, held under the auspices of the New Zealand Alliance for the supression of the sale of liquor, resolutions were adopted pledging an offer of support in the endeavour to have the principle of prohibition represented in the next Parliament, protesting against compensation to publicans whose houses were closed by popular veto, and resolving to take steps for educating the people upon the temperance question ... <i>(Dec 3, 1890,Evening Post,2</i>)</p>
<p>Like Father Hays and the British Alliance, our grand ideal is: local option for all, total abstinence for the individual, and no-license , or prohibition for the State. This has been the paramount aim of the New Zealand Alliance since its inception. <i>(May 11, 1905,West Coast Times,3</i>)</p>
<p>".. In the long run, though not now, the New Zealand Alliance may prove too strong for the publican party." <i>(Jul 19, 1871,Daily Southern Cross,2</i>)</p>
<p>He moved, "That this representative meeting of the New Zealand Alliance draws the attention of the Government to the request made by the Maoris at the congress held at Wellington in 1908, when the principle of local option should be extended to the Native race, and earnestly hopes that the numerous petitions presented by the Maoris to the Prime Minister will be favorably considered." <i>(Jun 28, 1910,Poverty Bay Herald,6</i>)</p>
<p>Bitter complaint was made.. as to the conduct of the New Zealand Alliance in regard to the Tauranga election. <i>(Oct 8, 1887,Auckland Weekly News,19</i>)</p>
<p>Some startling allegations as to the drinking habits of Maoris in Taranaki are contained in a petition presented to the House by Mr Atkinson from the Executive of the New Zealand Alliance. The petitioners forwarded with the petition a sworn declaration by the Rev. R. Haddon, of Hawera, Wesleyan Maori missionary, who is a half-caste, in reference to the disastrous effects of drink upon the Maoris of Taranaki. <i>(Oct 4, 1901,Poverty Bay Herald,4</i>)</p>
<p>Among the Members of Parliament pledged to the New Zealand Alliance are a number who represent "Continuance" constituencies.

From the 1960s historians have explored more neutral and more accurate terms to characterise the period. Some opted for <code>Land Wars', but this is not entirely satisfactory because issues were involved in addition to that of land. Others suggested</code>Anglo-Maori Wars' but this too is less than adequate; the English were not the only Europeans involved and. as already noted, Maoris fought on both sides. For this latter reason <code>Maori-Pakeha Wars' is also unsuitable. ...

<p>In the flat open space behind the pa there was a pole (or niu) standing used in their new Pai Marire religion. It was about 10 feet high, square for 2 or 3 feet at top &amp; bottom &amp; rounded in the middle. <i>Ibid.</i> 2/155 (A.S.Atkinson) I was curious to know where the first niu, or worshipping post, was set up &amp; when he said at Kaitake during the present war I said I did not see it there. <code>To you,' he said,</code>it was a color (flagstaff) to us it was a niu. . <i>Ibid.</i>2/228 (A.S.

<p><b>COWAN</b> This niu was the central symbol of worship under Te Ua's dispensation. The term was the olden Maori word for the short sticks used by the tohunga in his mystic arts of divination, particularly before a battle. Te Ua's niu was a tall pole or flag-mast, round which the faithful were to march in procession chanting their hymns. <i>Ibid..</i> 157 A tall niu, the pole of worship, stood in the principal part of the settlement; ... There were similar niu masts at other villages ... <i>(1922,NZ Wars, The,2/6</i>)</p>
<p><b>COWAN</b> At the principal villages in that rugged region ... the Hauhau poles, the sacred niu, were set up and round them marched the half-crazed people ... chanting their newly learned hymns ... the prayers of the `Kororia,' Maorified English phrases and scraps of English and Roman Catholic church services. <i>(1940,Sir Donald Maclean,85</i>)</p>
<p><b>BABBAGE</b> The central object of worship [of the new religion of Tella Haumene] was the <code>Niu.' The origin of this innovation was described in the following terms:- .in 2;</code>The Angel Gabriel said: <code>Go back to your house and erect a niu.' Horopapera enquired what a niu was. The Angel replied:</code>A post.' Horopapera enquired for what pur- pose? The Angel replied: <code>To work for you for the acquirement of the languages of all the races upon the earth.''

<p>niu, divination by means of small rods. Niu is a Polynesian name of the coconut, and in the Pacific the nut was spun in a divination rite: the Maori lost the name for the tree when he came to Newzealand, but retained it for the divinatory rite. The Hauhau fanatics gave the name niu to the pole they set up for their ceremonial dancing procession i[n] what was a horrid kind of maypole dance. <i>(1946,Journal of the Polynesian Society,55/154</i>) [NOTES: Andersen Maori Words in English]</p>
<p><b>SINCLAIR</b> The services of the new Maori evangelism were held at a niu, a long pole, perhaps fifty feet high, with yard-arms from which hung ropes.

<p>But that is Pakeha history. More significant are the Nui poles, erected in the early 1860s and well-known to canoeists who traverse the river today. The remaining two poles, at Marae-kowhai, are distinguished by their cross-arms reaching to the compass points, oneof which (Rongo Niu) has carved hands on it. From this flew the war pennants of the Pai Marire or Hauhau, around which the warriors danced prior to battle. <i>(Mar 31, 1983,Listener (New Zealand Listener),20</i>)</p>

<p>Kate Wilson, a Middlemarch farmer and one of the women behind rural website Not Just Gumboots and Scones, says the Internet is a serious tool for women involved in rural businesses. Not Just Gumboots and Scones was one of New Zealand's first rural information portals, built well before the launch of large commercial sites like www.fencepost.com.

<p><b>MORRIS</b> ~ a lump of gold. The noun nugget is not Australian, though often so supposed. Skeat (<code>Etymological Dictionary,' s.v.) gives a quotation from North's</code>Plutarch' with the word in a slightly different shape, viz., niggot. <code>The word nugget was in use in Australia many years before the goldfields were heard of. A thick-set young beast was called</code>a good nugget.' A bit of a fig of tobacco was called a nugget of tobacco .'' (G. W. Rusden.) [1852] <i>(1898,Austral English,323</i>)</p>

<p>Stray notes on Australia and the Diggings (Griffiths Collection) Origin of he word <code>Nugget'. - This word, now so common amongst our population, is a strange sounding word, and destitute of any apparent entymological meaning. It originated at the Ophir diggings in New South Wales, and is probably a corruption of</code>ingot', which is itself a corruption of <code>lingot', a little tongue. The wedge of gold which Achan purloined is called, in the original Hebrew, a</code>tongue' of gold, as a reference to a Bible with marginal readings will show. In California, the word <code>lump' is generally used, and sometimes the Spanish word</code>pepite.' <i>(Sep 30, 1852,Leisure Hour, The,640</i>)</p>
<p><b>A S THOMSON</b> In November [1852] I visited the diggings [at Thames], and procured the frog which is herewith sent. [221] It was got in this way. The gold-diggers were washing the soil of a mountain-stream in the machine called `long-tom'. In excavating the banks they displaced several large boulders of quartzy rock, underneath which was discovered the living frog. The gold-diggers, who voluntarily submit to the evils and miseries of such a gambling trade, and can rarely be excited by anything unless a great nugget, were so much astonished at the sight of a frog that one of them desisted fom the seductive occupation he was at, and took the frog, and put it into a bottle of water. <i>(1853,Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal,3/220-221</i>) [NOTES: 1853 A.S.
